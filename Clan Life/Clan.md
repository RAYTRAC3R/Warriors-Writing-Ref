Some cats live in a structured society divided into Clans. What sets the Clans apart from other cats are their belief of their ancestors. The Clans recognize two formal afterlives, StarClan and the Dark Forest. Clans have a structure defined by a leader, deputy, medicine cat, and the various cats who follow them.
