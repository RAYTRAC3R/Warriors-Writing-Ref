Newts are amphibious prey who are brown with a spotted underside, usually about a frog-length in size. It lives mostly nocturnally and hides during the day, adapting to various habitats. They feed on invertebrates and are eaten by cats, fish, birds, and snakes. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. They breed in ponds between Newleaf and Greenleaf, with males courting females with underwater displays.
