Edelweiss is a non-toxic mountain flower found in rocky limestone areas. It is a symbol of alpinism in the mountains.
The edelweiss plant, covered in white hairs and woolly leaves, grows to about a tail-length and blooms in Greenleaf and Leaf-fall, featuring clustered white-and-yellow florets.
Edelweiss is used to treat abdominal pain (such as bellyaches), breathing issues, and diarrhea, and is also used as a travelling herb.
